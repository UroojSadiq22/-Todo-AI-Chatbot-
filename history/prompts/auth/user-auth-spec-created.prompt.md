## Original Prompt

Implement user authentication using BetterAuth with JWT tokens, secure password hashing, and store all user and todos data in NeonDB. Ensure registration, login, and todos CRUD endpoints work properly with correct authorization.

## Actions Taken

1. Created feature branch `1-auth`
2. Generated comprehensive specification for user authentication with BetterAuth
3. Defined user scenarios, functional requirements, and success criteria
4. Created quality checklist to validate specification completeness

## Specification Summary

The specification defines a complete authentication system with:
- User registration with secure password hashing
- JWT-based authentication and session management
- Todo CRUD operations with proper authorization
- Data storage in NeonDB with user isolation

## Next Steps

Ready to proceed with planning and implementation of the authentication system based on this specification.
