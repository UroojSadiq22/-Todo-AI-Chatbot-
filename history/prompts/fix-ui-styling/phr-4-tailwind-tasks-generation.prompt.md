# Prompt History Record: Tailwind CSS Tasks Generation

## Original Prompt

[No specific prompt provided - generating tasks based on existing specification and plan for Tailwind CSS integration]

## Response Summary

Successfully generated comprehensive tasks for the Tailwind CSS integration fix. Created tasks.md file at specs/1-fix-ui-styling/tasks.md with 20 specific tasks organized across 6 phases:

1. Phase 1: Setup (2 tasks) - Create configuration files
2. Phase 2: Foundational (3 tasks) - Configure Tailwind properly
3. Phase 3: US1 - Basic styling (4 tasks) - Enable basic Tailwind styling
4. Phase 4: US2 - Responsive design (3 tasks) - Ensure responsive behavior
5. Phase 5: US3 - Interactive elements (3 tasks) - Add visual feedback
6. Phase 6: Polish & Verification (5 tasks) - Final verification and optimization

Tasks follow the required format with checkboxes, sequential IDs, story labels where appropriate, and specific file paths. The tasks address the root cause identified in research: missing tailwind.config.js and postcss.config.js files. Dependencies and parallel execution opportunities are documented. Implementation strategy prioritizes MVP delivery.
